# Sales Forecast Prediction ðŸ›’

Sales forecasting is an important aspect of business planning, helping organizations predict future sales and make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies and resource allocation. In this article we will explore how to build a sales forecast prediction model using Python. Sales forecasting involves estimating current or future sales based on data trends.

**Tech Stack:** Python | Scikit-Learn | XGBoost | Time Series Forecasting

**Description:**  
A time-series regression model built to forecast retail sales. The aim is to help businesses optimize inventory, allocate resources, and plan marketing strategies via accurate predictions.

**Key Features & Results:**
- Processed and analyzed **9,800+ sales records** with 12 features to model trends and seasonality.
- Engineered **5 lag-based features** to capture temporal dependencies.
- Built regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression); **XGBoost achieved RÂ² = 0.82, RMSE = 241.6**, marking a **15% improvement over baselines**.
- Visualized actual vs predicted sales using Matplotlib, offering actionable insights for inventory optimization and demand planning.
- As we can see the predicted and actual values are quite close to each other this proves the efficiency of our model. Sales forecasting using machine learning models like XGBoost can significantly enhance the accuracy of predictions by capturing temporal patterns in historical data. It can be used for improving sales predictions helping businesses optimize inventory, pricing and demand planning.
