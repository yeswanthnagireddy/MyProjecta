# Sales Forecast Prediction ðŸ›’

**Tech Stack:** Python | Scikit-Learn | XGBoost | Time Series Forecasting

**Description:**  
A time-series regression model built to forecast retail sales. The aim is to help businesses optimize inventory, allocate resources, and plan marketing strategies via accurate predictions.

**Key Features & Results:**
- Processed and analyzed **9,800+ sales records** with 12 features to model trends and seasonality.
- Engineered **5 lag-based features** to capture temporal dependencies.
- Built regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression); **XGBoost achieved RÂ² = 0.82, RMSE = 241.6**, marking a **15% improvement over baselines**.
- Visualized actual vs predicted sales using Matplotlib, offering actionable insights for inventory optimization and demand planning.
